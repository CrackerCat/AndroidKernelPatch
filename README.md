**English** | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md)

AndroidKernelPatch relies on [KernelPatch](https://github.com/bmax121/KernelPatch/)  and is the Android version of KernelPatch.

Not limited to rooting, AndroidKernelPatch can patch the kernel and inject arbitrary code into it even without source code or symbol information.
